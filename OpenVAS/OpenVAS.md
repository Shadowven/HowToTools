Open Vulnerability Assessment Scanning

## 1. Introduction

OpenVAS常用于扫描Endpoiont和网络应用程序以识别和漏洞检测。It is commonly used by corporations as part of their mitigation solutions to quickly identify any gaps in their production or even development servers or applications. 虽然不是万能的，但用来应付常见漏洞没啥问题。

From the OpenVAS GitHub repository "This is the Open Vulnerability Assessment Scanner (OpenVAS) of the Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM) Solution. It is used for the Greenbone Security Manager appliances and is a full-featured scan engine that executes a continuously updated and extended feed of Network Vulnerability Tests (NVTs)."
